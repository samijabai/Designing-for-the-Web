               <p>Sami Pet Shop is a locally owned and operated pet food and supply store. Our mission is to provide all the basic ameneties and toys for pets of all kind. It helps you to discover new products, prompting new ideas about how your pet's life could be improved, or even allowing you to evaluate whether pet ownership is for you. 
                   We love to talk about pets of all types and we are even more excited when you bring your furry family member into the store to meet us! We are constantly researching and learning about new products that can make our pets lives better. 
               </p>
               <p>As pet parents ourselves, we want to help every pet parent and their pet meet all their needs through our innovative products and services. Our hope is that we can play a meaningful role in bringing pets and their humans closer to each other for years and years to come, and through that build a kinder world.
                  Our doors opened for the first time on July 22, 2021 and we have been growing ever since. Thanks again for visiting our site and learning about our company! We will see you soon.
